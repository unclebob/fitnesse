Requesting a file from the ''files''' directory does not require authentication, but requesting a directory does.
A response with status 401 will be received signifying lack of authentication.

First setup the Authentication module.
!|Authenticator Setup|
|username|password|status?|
|Aladdin|open sesame||

Now request a file from the ''files'' directory.
We should get a 404 since file reading is allowed, but no such file exists.
!|Response Requester.|
|uri|status?|
|files/someFile |404     |

Now request the files directory.  We should get a 401 since we didn't suply any credentials.
!|Response Requester.|
|uri|status?|
|files/ |401     |

When we supply bad credintials we get a 401.
!|Response Requester.|
|uri|username|password|status?|
|files/ |Aladdin|open please|401|

Proper credentials give a ''not found'' (404) response; because requested file doesn't exist in this context.
!|Response Requester.|
|uri|username|password|status?|
|files/blah |Aladdin|open sesame|404|
