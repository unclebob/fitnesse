If we try to test a suite page that is marked secure-test, we'll have to authenticate.
A response with status 401 will be received signifying lack of authentication.

Create a page to be tested.
!|Page creator.|
|Page name.|page attributes|valid?|
|FrontPage |secure-test=true|true|

Now request a page.  We should get a 401 since we didn't suply any credentials.
!|Response Requester.|
|uri|status?|
|FrontPage?suite |401     |

When we supply bad credintials we get a 401.
!|Response Requester.|
|uri|username|password|status?|
|FrontPage?suite |Aladdin|open please|401|

Proper credentials give a successfull response.
!|Response Requester.|
|uri|username|password|status?|
|FrontPage?suite |Aladdin|open sesame|200|
