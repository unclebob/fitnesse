You can [[Define aliases][DefineAliasTest]] via tables in the wiki. It's also possible to add aliases via plugins. This has the advantage that the wiki is not cluttered with techical concerns.

To demonstrate this a class ''!-fitnesse.testsystems.slim.CustomTableAliasPlugin-!'' has been loaded in SetUp.

This plugin makes an alias from ''aliased echo fixture'' to the good old echo fixture.

So the following test table works:

!|script|
|given page|AliasTest|with content|!-!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}

| import |
| fitnesse.slim.test |

| script : my requirement |
| check | do business logic | 42 |
-!|
|check|request page|AliasTest?test|200|
|ensure|content contains|class="pass"|
|show|content|
