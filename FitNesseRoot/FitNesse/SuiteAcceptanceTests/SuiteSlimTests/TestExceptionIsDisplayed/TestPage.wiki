!2 if you expect an exception you can test for it and pass the test
use the keyword '''EXCEPTION:'''

| Test Slim |
|# Scenario| throw Normal?|throw Exception With Message?|
|Testing for an expected Exception|EXCEPTION:=~/This is my exception/|EXCEPTION:=~/Test message/|
|otherwise error is indicated. Watch how an exception with message is displayed shorter compared to a normal exception |This is my exception|Test message|

!2 if you expect an exception but there is non then the cell will fail
| Test Slim |
|string| getStringArg?|getStringArg?|
|Hello| Hello|EXCEPTION: Hello|



!2 An exception occurring in a not cell specific function call is added to the current row.
This applies to: execute, reset, table, beginTable, endTable

!|DT:fitnesse.slim.test.DecisionTableExecuteThrows|
|x|x?|
|5|5|

and also to constructor failures

!|DT:ConstructorThrows|test goes on|
|x|x?|
|5|5|


Multiple exceptions can happen in one row and in a in cell in the same row
!|DT:fitnesse.slim.test.DecisionTableExecuteThrows|
|Which Methods Fail|x|x?|
|NONE| 5|5|
|execute setX getX| 5|5|
|reset| 2|2|
|reset| 5|5|

!4 Everything goes wrong - Fitnesse catches all 7 exceptions 
The exceptions are added at the right level: 
 * cell - for getter and setter 
 * row - for reset and execute
 * table - for table, beginTable and endTable
 
!|DT:fitnesse.slim.test.DecisionTableExecuteThrows|Total Disaster|
|x|x?|

!1 Scripts behave like decision tables

!|script:fitnesse.slim.test.DecisionTableExecuteThrows|
|check |execute|EXCEPTION: =~/EXECUTE_THROWS/|

A stop test is counted as fail and not as error
!|script:ConstructorThrows|stop test|
|check |execute|Not reached as test is stopped|
