Help: For distributed testing or to debug fixture code locally it can be helpful to connect to a manually started SlimService
Test
---
The below configuration option is useful in two scenarios

!3 1) Pretesting on a developer workstation
GIVEN you run a central !-FitNesse-! Wiki
WHEN your developer did some code changes on his workstation
AND he wants to see if the test still pass
THEN you can start a !-SlimService-! on his workstation manual
AND can execute all tests from your central Wiki 

!3 2) Distributed Testing
Given you run a central !-FitNesse-! Wiki on Linux
WHEN you need to test some .net code on Windows
THEN you can start a .Net !-SlimService-! on your Windows Server manual and run it in daemon mode
AND can execute the test case from your central Wiki 

Configure the test system as below:

{{{
!define MANUALLY_START_TEST_RUNNER (true)
!define slim.pool.size (1)
!define SLIM_PORT {YOUR TEST PORT}
!define SLIM_HOST {WORKSTATION or SERVER NAME}
}}}

To demonstrate this we connect to fitnesse.org's webserver. This should connect but fail with a message that no Slim Header has been provided.
Tip: Increase the slim.timeout if you need more time to startup the !-SlimService-! manual
Important: '''!define slim.pool.size (1)'''  to avoid to try any other port than the port you specified.
