!2 Identify if the Slim Server process dies during startup
 
If a slim server process dies before a connection has been established this should be identified quickly and the test aborted.
We use a test runner class which doesn't exists. This ensures the slim server dies.

!| script |
| create page | TestPage | with content | !-
!define TEST_SYSTEM {SLIM}
!define slim.timeout {1}
!define TEST_RUNNER {something.that.does.not.exists}
