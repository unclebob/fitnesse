!2 Trying to connect to a socket where no slim server is running should fail quickly.

To test this we run in debug mode and request to start the slim server ourselfs. But we never start one :)

Use the property slim.timeout to define how long the test system should wait for the slim client. The default is 10 seconds.
In this test we set it to 1 second.

Required Improvement: also the timeout is set to 1 second the detection takes 20 seconds :(
