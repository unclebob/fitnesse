!2 Trying to connect to a socket where no slim server is running should fail quickly.

To test this we run in debug mode and request to start the slim server ourselfs. But we never start one :)

Use the property slim.timeout to define how long the test system should wait for the slim client. The default is 10 seconds.
In this test we set it to 1 second.

!| script |
| create page | TestPage | with content | !-
!define TEST_SYSTEM {SLIM}
!define slim.timeout {1}
!define SLIM_PORT {8099}
!define MANUALLY_START_TEST_RUNNER_ON_DEBUG (true)
