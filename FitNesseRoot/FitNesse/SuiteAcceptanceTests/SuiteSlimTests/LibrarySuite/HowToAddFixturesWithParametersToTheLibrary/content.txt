!|import           |
|fitnesse.slim.test|

!2 Create a fixture with constructor parameters

Negative Test: This must raise an exception as the method query can not be found
!|script|echo fixture                                |
|check  |echo |AAA                |AAA               |
|#check |query|[[[n, 1], [2n, 2]], [[n, 2], [2n, 4]]]|

!3 The entries in a library table can have constructor parameters in the same way as a script fixture.

!|library|
|test query|2|

!|script|echo fixture                                |
|check  |echo |BBB                |BBB               |
|check  |query|[[[n, 1], [2n, 2]], [[n, 2], [2n, 4]]]|

If you need further set up by calling methods of the fixture before adding it to the library you can use synbols to do this.
At the end assign the fixture itself to a symbol. 

!|script|test slim|47|
|set string   |Hello FitNesse       |
|$ts=   |get fixture |


Now add the previously created fixture symbol to the library
|library|
|$ts    |

And here we go: We can use the methods of the fixture in any script
!|script|echo fixture                                |
|check  |echo |CCC                |CCC               |
|check  |getStringArg|Hello FitNesse|
