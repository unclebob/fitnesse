Values in hash tables should be handled in the same fashion as normal values passed to Slim.
| script | hash fixture |
| send | !{script:<em><b>bold</b></em>} | as hash |
| check | hash | script | is | <em><b>bold</b></em> |

For comparison, this is how it works with a normal value:

!| script | echo fixture |
| echo | <em><b>bold</b></em> | and log |
