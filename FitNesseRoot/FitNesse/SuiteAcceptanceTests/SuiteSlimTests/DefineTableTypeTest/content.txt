Purpose:  Checks that the Define Table Type table works

By default table should be parsed as a decision table.
|Table Or Decision Fixture |
|parsing as?               |
|Parsed as Decision fixture|


However after this table it should be parsed as a '''Table: table'''.

|Define Table Type                 |
|Table or Decision Fixture|as Table|


|Table Or Decision Fixture          |
|parsing as?|Parsed as Table fixture|

The same works for script tables (which parse as decision tables in many respects).
