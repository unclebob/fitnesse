!3 When a page is renamed, any internal links to that page are changed.

If you have a page that refers to itself, then its internal references will be changed.

First build the page with a self reference.

|Page creator.|
|Page name.|Page contents.|Page attributes.|valid?|
|!-MyPage-!|!-refer to self MyPage-!||true|

Then rename that page.

|Response Requester.|
|uri   |status?|
|!-MyPage?responder=renamePage&newName=ThePage&refactorReferences=on-!||

Next fetch the page.

|Response Requester.|
|uri|valid?|contents?|
|!-ThePage-!|true||

Make sure that the new name is present and that the old name is not.

|Response Examiner.|
|type  |pattern|matches?|wrapped html?|
|contents|!-ThePage-!|true||

|Response Examiner.|
|type  |pattern|matches?|
|contents|!-MyPage-!|false|
