!c !3 BUG! submitted by Etienne Charignon
!c !3 When you attempt to move a page inside of itself, you should get an error message.
!c ''prior to fix, an endless number of nested pages, all with the same name, would get created untill the os complained.''

First build a page to move.

!|Page creator.|
|Page name.          |Page contents.|valid?|
|TestPage| some content |true   |

Then try to move the sub page inside itself.  We should get an error (400).

!|Response Requester.|
|uri   |status?|
|TestPage?responder=movePage&newLocation=TestPage|400|

We should be told that we cannot move the page.

|Response Examiner.|
|type  |pattern|matches?|wrapped html?|
|contents|Cannot move|true||
