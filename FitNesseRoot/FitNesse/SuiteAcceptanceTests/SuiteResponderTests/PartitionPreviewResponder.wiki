Suite

The partition preview responder can show how the 'Suite Responder' will split a suite in sub-suites when using the !style_code(partitionIndex) and !style_code(partitionCount) parameters.

When you execute a suite page indicating that you want to partition the suite (i.e. split it in parts) and only run one partition, !-FitNesse-! should only run that partition.

The partition preview responder shows which pages go in which partition, and how the tests will be ordered in the test system.
It can either provide its output in HTML (the default) or as tab separated. Tab separated format can be requested by supplying the !style_code(format) parameter with value !style_code(tsv).
