!3 BUG - when you define a classpath entry on a line immediately following a variable definition, the classpath entry is not processed and the fixtures are therefore not found.
----
First, build a page with variable definitions followed immediately by a classpath definition. Also include a test that should pass.

!| script |
| given page | ClasspathTestPage | with content | !-!define PI {3.141592}
| fitnesse.testutil.PassFixture |-! |
| make | ClasspathTestPage | a test page |
| its test results should contain | PassFixture |
| and should not contain | Exception |
| check | request page | ErrorLogs.ClasspathTestPage | 200 |
| show | content |
