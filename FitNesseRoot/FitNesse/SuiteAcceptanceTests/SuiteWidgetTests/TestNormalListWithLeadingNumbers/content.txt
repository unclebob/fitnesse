!3 Normal lists with leading numbers
An old bug in Fitnesse.  If you created a normal list with leading numbers in the text, the parser got confused and thought that the leading numbers were part of a numeric list.

A list created as follows {{{* 50 ways to leave your lover}}} should be rendered as a normal list with "50 ways to leave your lover" as the text of the list.
#
 * First create a page with a simple table in it.
#
!note We use \ here as a way to capture the leading space before the *.
