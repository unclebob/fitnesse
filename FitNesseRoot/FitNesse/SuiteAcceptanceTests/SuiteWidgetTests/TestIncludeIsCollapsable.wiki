!3 Included Pages are Collapsable
When a page is included it is included within a division that is collapsable.

The following is a test that demonstrates how this works.
#
 * First create a page to be included.
#
|script|
|start|Page Builder|
|line|included|
|page|!-IncludedPage-!|
#
 * Next create a page to do the including.
#
|script|
|start|Page Builder|
|line|before|
|line|!-&bang;include IncludedPage-! |
|line|after|
|page|!-IncludingPage-!|
#
 * Then request the including page.
#
|Response Requester.|
|uri|valid?|contents?|
|!-IncludingPage-!|true||
#
 * Examine the requested page to be sure the included page was in fact included.
