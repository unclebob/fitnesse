!3 This page tests seamless includes on a wiki page.

'''NOTE - this is not part of the 20050301 release, but is checked in and will be part of the next release'''

You can follow !include (see TestInclude) with the option "!--seamless-!", which renders the included comment with no additional decoration.

The following is a test that demonstrates how this works.
#
 * First create a page to be included.
#
|script|
|start|Page Builder|
|line|included line 1|
|line|included line 2|
|page|!-IncludedPage-!|
#
 * Next create a page to do the including.
#
|script|
|start|Page Builder|
|line|before|
|line|!-&bang;include -seamless IncludedPage-! |
|line|after|
|page|!-IncludingPage-!|
#
 * Then request the including page.
#
|Response Requester.|
|uri|valid?|contents?|
|!-IncludingPage-!|true||
#
 * Examine the requested page to be sure the included page was in fact included.
#
|Response Examiner.|
|type|pattern|matches?|value|
|contents|included|true||
#
 * Now look at every line on the including page to make sure that the inclusions were done in order.
