!3 BUG REPORT: Single Character Italics don't work right.
{{{
From David Hooker:

In my page, I have the following markup:

All files received within the ''do...while'' loop will be stored using the
names "reply'''-x'''", where ''x'' is a number corresponding to which pass
through the loop the fixture is taking.

If I put two single quotes around the letter x (in red above), it starts an
italic section, but the closing two single quotes do not stop the italics,
and the entire rest of my page is itallics.  Bold markup does not seem to have
this problem.

----

First create a page with a single italic character on it.
