What if you want to execute the same fitnesse test multiple times. This seems like nice a candidate for a decorator.

If you want to loop 5 times over a fitnesse table and make sure each time the test does not take more than 1000 milliseconds.

!|Loop|5|times|
|Max Time|1000|milliseconds|
|Division|
|numerator|denominator|quotient()|
|10|2|5|
|12.6|3|4.2|
|100|4|25|

Once you run this test, you can see actual time taken for each run. In our case, we'll see 5 actual timing printed, since we are looping 5 times.

'''Note:''' As you can see, you can pipe decorators. Similar to how you can pipe Unix shell commands.
