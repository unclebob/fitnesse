What if you want to specify a time range for your fitnesse fixtures?

!|Time Range|0|milliseconds min and max|200|milliseconds|
|Division|
|numerator|denominator|quotient()|
|10|2|5|
|12.6|3|4.2|
|100|4|25|

In this example, you want to make sure all the division don't take less than 0 milliseconds and more than 50 milliseconds.

By now you should be aware that these decorators ignore alternative column names.

!|Time Range|0|alternative column values are ignored|200|this is ignored as well|
|Division|
|numerator|denominator|quotient()|
|10|2|5|
|12.6|3|4.2|
|100|4|25|
