This page is required for technical reasons:
By setting the property flag "Skip (Recursive)" it stops the test suite from testing the business requirements directly.
The requirements should only be tested via suites which implement them and link to the requirements via a symbolic link.
if the "Skip (Recursive)" flag would be set on the >BusinessRequirements suite page direcly the suite would be skipped when called via a symbolic link.
Therfore this page is required.
