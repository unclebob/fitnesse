!2 Defining and Expressing Variables.
You can define a variable to represent any amount of text.  The text in a variable is never interpreted as wiki markup.  It is always raw literal text.
 * Variable names may contain letters, numbers, and periods; e.g., MYTEST.someVar or user.name
 * You can define a variable like this: !-!define var {text}-!
 * Or you can define a variable like this !-!define var (text)-!
  * The reason there are two forms is so that you can include braces or parenthesis in your variables.
 * The variable text can span many lines as shown below:
{{{
!define myVariable {
This is the
text of my
variable
}  }}}
!define myVariable {
this is the
text of my
variable
}
You express the value of a variable like this: !-${myVariable}-!.  This expression is replaced with the value of the variable.

''The value of the variable is: ${myVariable}.''

If a variable is expressed on a page, but is not found, then its parent pages are searched in order.
If the variable is not found in any ancestor pages, FitNesse will inspect System.properties.

There are several [[pre-defined variables][.FitNesse.PreDefinedVariables]] that you can use on your pages.

See [[Variable fitnesse test][.FitNesse.SuiteAcceptanceTests.SuiteWidgetTests.TestVariables]], [[Parent Variable fitnesse test][.FitNesse.SuiteAcceptanceTests.SuiteWidgetTests.TestParentVariables]] and [[Define Variables in System Properties test][.FitNesse.SuiteAcceptanceTests.SuiteWidgetTests.TestVariablesFromSystemProperties]]
