!2 Downloading and Installing FitNesse
It really takes very little time and effort to get FitNesse running on your machine.
 1 Go to !style_code(http://fitnesse.org/FrontPage.FitNesseDevelopment.DownLoad) and click on the most recent !style_code(fitnesse-standalone.jar) file.
  * If this is a brand new installation, just put it in some convenient empty directory.
  * If this is an update, then copy it on top of the old fitnesse(-standalone).jar in your current installation.
 2 Type !style_code(java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar)
  * It will ask you to be patient as it installs or updates.
  * Your shell should respond with something like this:
   !img http://files/images/fitnessestarted.png
 3 Start up a browser and go to !style_code(http://localhost)
 4 The main FitNesse screen should come up. That's it. You're ready to start using FitNesse.

!3 It didn't work!
Most likely you have another web server running.  Web servers default to port 80, so if another one is running on your machine you'll have to specify another port via a CommandLineOption.  Try this command:
 !style_code(java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar -p 8080)

Then point your browser to !style_code(http://localhost:8080)

!**> Still no?  Open me up.
!2 What to Do If You Have the Wrong Java Runtime Environment
FitNesse requires version 1.5 or later of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
If you see the messages:

{{{
C:\fitnesse>java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
java/lang/CharSequence
        at fitnesse.FitNesse.parseCommandLine(Unknown Source)
        at fitnesse.FitNesse.main(Unknown Source)
}}}

Then you need to download and install version 1.5 or later of the JRE. Follow these steps:
 * Press a key to close the command window
 * Go to [[this download link][https://jsecom15a.sun.com:443/ECom/EComActionServlet;jsessionid=jsecom15a.sun.com-9752%3A415dafbe%3A147685f2fbcc1de1]].
 * Accept the terms of agreement (if you are permitted), and click Continue.
 * Download the right JRE installer for your machine and operating system.
 * Launch the installer, and follow its instructions to install JRE 1.5 or later.
 * Change the PATH environment variable so that it points to the new JRE.
   * Go to the /bin folder that contains java.exe, and copy the pathname (for example, ''C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.5.0_13'')
   * Go to Settings>Control Panel>System>Advanced>Environment Variables>PATH>Edit
   * Paste in that same complete pathname
   * Save the PATH environment variable, and close the System control panel
 * Double-click run.bat again.
 * Return to DownloadingAndInstallingFitNesse.

!2 What to do if Apache Velocity is not found
There are two builds of the FitNesse binary:
 * '''fitnesse.jar''' contains only the fitnesse code, no dependencies. This is the version you use if you're using a dependency management system like [[Maven][http://maven.apache.org/]] or [[Apache Ivy][http://ant.apache.org/ivy/]].
 * '''fitnesse-standalone.jar''' is the big one-has-all jar file containing FitNesse and support libraries.

If you're seeing this:

{{{
C:\fitnesse>java -jar fitnesse.jar
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/velocity/context/Context
        at fitnesse.FitNesseContext.(FitNesseContext.java:29)
        at fitnesse.FitNesseContext.(FitNesseContext.java:39)
        at fitnesseMain.FitNesseMain.loadContext(FitNesseMain.java:88)
        at fitnesseMain.FitNesseMain.launchFitNesse(FitNesseMain.java:36)
}}}

You probably want the latter.

!2 Learning More
If you have not yet done so, check out the TwoMinuteExample. To learn more about what FitNesse acceptance testing is all about, see AcceptanceTests.  If you are ready to start creating FitNesse pages and test tables, check out EditingFitNessePages and CreatingTestTables.

!2 Memory Issues.
With the 20090320 release, some operations in !-FitNesse-! take more than the default memory allocated to the JVM.  This can cause tests to fail for ''out of heap space'' reasons.  You can fix this by adding the !style_code(!--Xmx100M-!) JVM argument to the java command line when you start !-FitNesse-!.  !style_code(!-java -Xmx100M -jar fitnesse.jar-!).

!3 Memory issues and the build.
If you build !-FitNesse-! from source, the ant script may fail for ''out of heap space'' reasons.  You can fix this by setting the !style_code(ANT_OPTS) environment variable to !style_code(!--Xmx100M-!).
