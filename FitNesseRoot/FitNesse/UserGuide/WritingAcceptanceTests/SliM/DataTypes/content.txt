!1 Data types
 * For numerics, the Java format is used. e.g. Integer.parseInt() or Double,parseDouble() calls.
 * Boolean maps to the strings "true" and "false".
 * Dates convert in and out of a date format of the form dd-MMM-yyyy. (e.g. 10-Oct-1970)
 * Lists of strings are mapped to simple strings of the form ''[a, b, c]''.  Note the brackets and spaces.  This is the standard ''toString'' format for Java Lists.
 * Arrays of Booleans, Integers, Strings, and Doubles map to the form ''[x, y, z]''.
