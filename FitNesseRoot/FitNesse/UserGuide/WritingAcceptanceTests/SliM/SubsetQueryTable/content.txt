The first thing to notice is the ''Subset Query:'' in the first cell of the table.  This tells the Slim table processor that this is a subset query table. Subset query tables are almost identical to [[Query tables][QueryTable]] except that we only need to put those rows into the table that we want to make sure to exist in the query response.

Our definition of subset here is not ''proper'' subset. Thus the table may contain all the rows of the query response.
