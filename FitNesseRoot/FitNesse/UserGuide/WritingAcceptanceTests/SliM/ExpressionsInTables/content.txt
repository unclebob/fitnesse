|DT:some decision table          |
|input                   |output?|
|!{key1:value1,key2:val2}|$map=  |
|$`map.key1`             |value1 |
|$`1+2`                  |3      |

If an $''`expression`'' appears in a cell (whether in a Decision Table, Script Table, or any other kind of table that can call functions) then that expression will be evaluated.

The first row above loads a hashtable in the symbol named ''map''.  The second row will valuate the expression ''map.key1'' and return the expression's result (value1). The third row evaluates an expression that doesn't use a symbol that's stored.

You can combine symbols as follows:

|$`map.key1` and $`1+2` come from expressions|

Both expressions will be evaluated and replaced with their result values.
