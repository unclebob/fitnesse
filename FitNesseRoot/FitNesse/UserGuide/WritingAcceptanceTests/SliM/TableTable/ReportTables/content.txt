!3 Generating reports inside pages using Table tables.

Since you can pass back any size result to a Table table, and since you can create a Table table that has only one row, you can generate reports.

For example:

|table:counts|

This table will execute the !style_code(doTable) method of the !style_code(counts) fixture.  If that method returns a table like this:{{{[
  [report:Employees,pass:22],
  [report:Managers,fail:21]
]}}} then the resulting table will be

|!style_pass(table:counts)|
|Employees|!style_pass(22)|
|Managers|!style_fail(21)|
