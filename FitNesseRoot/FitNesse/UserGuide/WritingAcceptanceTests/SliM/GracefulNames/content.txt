The names of fixtures, methods, inputs, and outputs can be expressed in two forms.  They can match their corresponding names in the fixture classes, or they can be ''graceful''.

A ''graceful name'' looks like it is written in human language rather than computer language.  It has spaces that separate the words and may have a period at the end.  Slim will convert ''graceful names'' into the names of the classes and methods they refer to.  So for example:

!|Graceful Name|Fixture Name|Method Name|
|slim test|SlimTest|slimTest|
|login user.|LoginUser|loginUser|
|Open connection and add user.|OpenConnectionAndAddUser|openConnectionAndAddUser|
