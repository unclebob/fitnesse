You can use all the standard Java data types in RowFixture and ColumnFixture.  These types are automatically translated in and out of cell contents for you.  They include:

 * String
  * A trimmed string.  You can use the keyword ''null'' or ''blank'' to mean a true java null, or an empty string respectively
 * byte or Byte
 * short or Short
 * int or Integer
 * long or Long
 * float or Float
 * double or Double
 * char or Character
 * boolean or Boolean
  * Will interpret ''true'', ''yes'', ''y'', ''+'', ''1'' to be true.
  * All else will be false.
 * Array
  * Any comma separated list of items will be converted into an array.

Any user defined type that implements toString and parse will be managed correctly by RowFixture and ColumnFixture.  The signatures of these methods are:{{{String toString();
static Object parse(String s);}}}
