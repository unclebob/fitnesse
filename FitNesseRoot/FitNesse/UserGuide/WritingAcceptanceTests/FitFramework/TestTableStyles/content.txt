As we've seen, every FitNesse test table begins with a row that contains the classname of the [[Fixture Code][<UserGuide.WritingAcceptanceTests.FixtureCode]] that will interpret the rest of the table. The rest of the rows in a test table depend on which style of table and fixture we are using (each style of test table has its own style of fixture code).

Here we point you to pages that describe each of the styles of FitNesse test table, and the fixture code used to interpret and run them as tests.

!2 The Most Common Table/Fixture Styles
|ColumnFixture|''This is the style you may end up using most: rows of data represent inputs and expected outputs.''|
|RowFixture|''This is good for testing queries that should return an exact set of values (order-independently).''|
|ActionFixture|''This style allows you write a script that emulates a series of events (such as controls manipulated on a user interface).''|
|CommentTables|''Sometimes you want a tabular comment that is not executed as a test.''|

!2 Less Frequently-Used Table/Fixture Styles
|RowEntryFixture|''A special case of ColumnFixture for processing rows of data.''|
|TableFixture|''A fixture style that lets you create completely custom test table formats, and process them however you like.''|
|SummaryFixture|''A fixture that generates a report of all the tests on a page.''|

!2 Some extra things about Fit Tables that vary from port to port.
|SymbolsInTestTables|''Some ports of FIT allow symbols to be passed in Column and Row fixtures.  This is very inconsistent amongst the different FIT ports.''|
|KeywordsInTestTables|''Some ports of FIT allow keywords blank, null, and error.  This is very inconsistent between FIT ports.''|
|ComparisonExpressionsInFixtures|''You can put comparison expressions in the cells of your test tables.''|
|ParametersInFixtures|''Allows you to pass arguments into a fixture.''|
|DataTypesInFixtures|''Which data types FitNesse and Fit can handle in test tables.''|
|TroubleShootingAcceptanceTests|''How to investigate problems when running test tables.''|
