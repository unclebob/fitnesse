!2 Seeing How Long ActionFixture Actions Take: !-TimedActionFixture-!

You can used !-TimedActionFixture-! if you want to see visual feedback on how long certain functions take to execute.

|!-fit.TimedActionFixture-!|
|start|!-fitnesse.fixtures.DelayedCountFixture-!|
|check|counter|0|
|press|count|
|check|counter|1|
|press|count|
|check|counter|2|
|enter|counter|5|
|press|count|
|check|counter|6|

The !-DelayedCountFixture-! used above simply adds a random delay to the ''count'' function.

The !-TimedActionFixture-! does not report any delays that are less than one second.  I don't know why Ward decided to impose this lower limit.  Perhaps he'll remove it one day.

This fixture does not appear to give you access to the time or the ''split''.  It just displays them for your edification.
