!3 A Fixture for summarising the tests run on a page.

The [[!-FitFramework-!][<UserGuide.WritingAcceptanceTests.FitFramework]] provides a fixture that will, when the page is run as a test, print a summary of the test results like so:

-!|Comment|
|Summary|
|counts|2 right, 1 wrong, 7 ignored, 0 exceptions|
|run date|Sat Mar 07 15:58:46 GMT 2015|
|run elapsed time|0:00.10|

Run this page to see an example.  We include the division example to provide some statistics to summarise.

!| eg.Division |
| numerator | denominator | quotient? |
| 10 | 2 | 5 |
| 12.6 | 3 | 4.2 |
| 100 | 4 | 33 |

And here is the summary.
