!1 Using Comment Tables
Sometimes you just want to explain something using a table. You don't want it to be a test table. But FitNesse presumes all tables are test tables. You need a CommentTable.

You can make comment tables using the ''Comment'' table notation. It's simple. Simply put the word ''Comment'' all alone in the first row of the table, like so:

|Comment|
|This table is just a comment|
|and will not participate|
|in the tests on this page.|

If you click the Test button on a page containing such comment tables, FitNesse and the [[!-FitFramework-!][<UserGuide.WritingAcceptanceTests.FitFramework]] will ignore the comment tables.
