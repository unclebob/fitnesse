!1 !c Acceptance Test Patterns.
There seem to be patterns associated with writing acceptance tests with Fit and FitNesse.

| >BuildOperateCheck | ''Three tables for each test.'' |
| >CommonIncludes | ''Avoid duplicate test content by creating pages that are included into tests.'' |
| >ParameterizedIncludes | ''Using variables and Includes together to achieve function-like behavior.'' |
| >StaticBeforeDynamic | ''First check the end results, then check the in-process results.'' |
| >OperateFunction | ''Column Fixtures often need a special function to perform an operation between input and output.'' |
