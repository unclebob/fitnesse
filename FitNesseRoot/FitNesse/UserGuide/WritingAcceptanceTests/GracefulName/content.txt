!1 Improving Readability using ''Graceful Names''
If you are not yet accustomed to it, you can make your test tables much more pleasant to read by using ''graceful name'' notation.

Say you have a fixture class named ''!-payroll.fixtures.PaycheckInspector-!'' you can references in your fixture tables as ''Paycheck inspector''.  Both Fit and Slim will manipulate that name back into ''!-PaycheckInspector-!'' by removing punctuation and using camel case.  They will then hunt through a list of known packages for the fixture.

A similar transformation happens with variable and method names too.

Therefore instead of this:

!|payroll.fixtures.PaycheckInspector|
|employeeId|employeeName|payAmount()|
|24|Bob|1500|

You can have this:

!|Paycheck inspector.|
|employee id|employee name|pay amount?|
|24|Bob|1500|

You can add to the list of packages by using the ''Import'' fixture as follows.

|Import|
|payroll.fixtures|

This table should appear ''above'' the tables that use the ''!-PaycheckInspector-!'' fixture.  It's a good idea to put your ''Import'' fixtures in a !-SetUp-! page.
