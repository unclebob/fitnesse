Acceptance tests are run by hitting the '''Test''' button (or typing ''ALT-t'').  This button appears on any page that has the '''Test''' attribute set.  See [[Page Attributes][PageProperties]].

Any tables that are on the page are run through the Fit framework (See http://fit.c2.com ).

So, for example, click the '''Test''' button (or type ''ALT-t'') and see what happens to the table below:

|eg.Division|
|numerator|denominator|quotient?|
|10|2|5|
|12.6|3|4.2|
|-3|3|-1|
|100|0|0|
|33|3|11|
