Variable are in scope if they are defined on the page in question or in somewhere in the parent hierarchy of the page in question.

For example, lets say the variable we are interested in is X.

 * If X is defined on this page then it is definately in scope.
 * If X is not defined on this page but is defined in the page .FitNesse (this page's parent), then X is still in scope.
 * If X is defined on .FitNesse.UserGuide.FitNesseWiki then X is not in scope because .FitNesse.UserGuide.FitNesseWiki is not a parent of this page.

All variables that have been declared using !define can be checked by adding ?variables at the end. For example .FitNesse.UserGuide.FitNesseWiki?variables will show a table with the names, their values and their location on the pages path.
