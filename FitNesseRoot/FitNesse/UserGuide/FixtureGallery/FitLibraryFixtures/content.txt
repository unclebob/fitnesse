!2 !-FitLibrary Fixtures-!
!- FitLibrary started as a third-party set of fixtures, but it was so useful that it is now considered part of the standard test types. For the Java version, it is still maintained as a separate library but it is packaged within the UserGuide bundle. The .NET versions of FIT and FitLibrary are distributed together in the same package ( FitLibrary is just a separate DLL). -!
