!2 !-Markup Variables-!
Markup variables are used for macro-replacement in pages. They provide another way to parameterize your tests with static values (not changing during a test execution). Define a variable using: {{{
!define variablename {value} }}}
and then use it anywhere in the page with this syntax: {{{
!-${value}-! }}}
Unlike symbols, markup variables can be used also as a part of a cell. Note that variables are processed while building the HTML page, so they are not available to fixtures at runtime. Here is an example: {{{
!define town {Houston}

|ColumnFixtureTest|
|firstPart|secondPart|together?|
|Hello|World|Hello, World|
|&dollar;{town}|We Have a Problem|&dollar;{town}, We Have a Problem|

}}}
Markup variables are especially useful to extract a common value to a single place, so that it can be changed easily. They can also be used to parameterise included pages. For example, you can write a test component that is frequently used, and then call it with different parameter values by using markup variables. See <UserGuide.ParameterizedIncludes for an example.
