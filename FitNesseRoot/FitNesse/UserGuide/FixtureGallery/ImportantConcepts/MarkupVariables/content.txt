!2 !-Markup Variables-!
!-Markup variables are used for macro-replacement in<UserGuide pages. They provide another way to parameterise your tests with static values (not changing during a test execution). Define a variable using:-!

{{{
!define variablename {value}
}}}
!-and then use it anywhere in the page with this syntax:-!

{{{
${value}
}}}
!-Unlike symbols, markup variables can be used also as a part of a cell. Note that variables are processed in<UserGuide while building the HTML page, so they are not available to fixtures at runtime. Here is an example:-!

{{{
!-!-!define town {Houston}

!-!-!|ColumnFixtureTest|
|firstPart|secondPart|together?|
|Hello|World|Hello, World|
|${town}|We Have a Problem|${town}, We Have a Problem|

}}}
!-Markup variables are especially useful to extract a common value to a single place, so that it can be changed easily. They can also be used to parameterise included pages. For example, you can write a test component that is frequently used, and then call it with different parameter values by using markup variables. See -!http://fitnesse.org<UserGuide.ParameterizedIncludes !- for an example.-!
