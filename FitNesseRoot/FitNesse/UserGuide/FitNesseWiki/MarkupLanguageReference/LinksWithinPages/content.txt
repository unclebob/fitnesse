When you have really longs pages it is convenient to list a bunch of links at the top of the page that will take you to sections further down in the page.  With a combination of a couple of wiki widgets, you can achieve this usefulness in FitNesse.

The first component is called an '''Anchor'''.  Use anchors to designate locations in a page that you want to link to.  Create anchors like this:
'''!-!anchor anchorName-!'''
When saved, you wont see the anchors but they'll be there in the document.

Now you just need to create a link to them.  You do that with the following syntax:
'''!-.#pageBottom-!'''
When saved this will turn into a link to the anchor named '''pageBottom''' in this case.

.#pageBottom

At the very bottom of this page, there is an anchor named '''pageBottom'''.  When you click in the link above, you will be taken to that hidden anchor.

And now, a little poem by '''William Butler Yeats''' to fill the space:

That civilisation may not sink,

Its great battle lost,

Quiet the dog, tether the pony

To a distant post;

Our master Caesar is in the tent

Where the maps ate spread,

His eyes fixed upon nothing,

A hand under his head.

(Like a long-legged fly upon the stream

His mind moves upon silence.)

That the topless towers be burnt

And men recall that face,

Move most gently if move you must

In this lonely place.

She thinks, part woman, three parts a child,

That nobody looks; her feet

Practise a tinker shuffle

Picked up on a street.

(Like a long-legged fly upon the stream

Her mind moves upon silence.)

That girls at puberty may find

The first Adam in their thought,

Shut the door of the Pope's chapel,

Keep those children out.

There on that scaffolding reclines

Michael Angelo.

With no more sound than the mice make

His hand moves to and fro.

(Like a long-legged fly upon the stream

His mind moves upon silence.)
