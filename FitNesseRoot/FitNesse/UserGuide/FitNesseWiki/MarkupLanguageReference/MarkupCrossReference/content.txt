You can add a ''Cross Reference'' to another page with the !-!see-! statement.

|!c '''Markup Text'''|!c '''Displayed as'''|
|!-!see .FrontPage-!|!see .FrontPage|

Aside from being a nice syntax for cross references, this widget is also used in [[test suites][TestSuites]].  If a test suite page refers to test pages with !-!see-! statements, then when the suite is executed, the cross referenced tests will be added to the suite.  If a test page has a !-!see-! markup, it is ignored completely even if the page is part of a suite or sub-suite.

The path to the referenced page may be an absolute or a relative path.
