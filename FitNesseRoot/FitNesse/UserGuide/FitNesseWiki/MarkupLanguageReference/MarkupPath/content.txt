There are some special functions in FitNesse that require you to name a directory path.  You do this with the !path directive.

|!c '''Markup Text'''|!c '''Displays as'''|
|!-!path c:\directory-!|!path c:\directory|

You can also specify all the .jar files in a directory by using a wildcard:
{{{!-!path /usr/javalib/*.jar-!}}}

Or you can specify all .jar files in a directory ''and all subdirectories'' by using the ** wildcard.
{{{!-!path /usr/javalib/**.jar-!}}}

Paths such as these will be used when you press the ''test'' or ''suite'' buttons on a page.
