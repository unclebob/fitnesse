Tables can be created very easily.  Use the vertical stroke as the first character of the line, and separate each table cell with it:

'''Markup Text'''
{{{|Alpha|
|Beta|gamma|Delta|
|1|2|3|}}}----
'''Displays as:'''
|Alpha|
|Beta|gamma|Delta|
|1|2|3|

You can use most wiki markup directives in table cells, including !c, !1, !2, !3, bold, and italic.
!2 Literal tables.
If you don't want any markup directives interpreted in the table, then you can use a special form that is preceded with a ! and like this:

'''Markup Text'''
{{{!|ThisTableWillNotInterpret|!c any directives|'''it is treated'''|
|!1 like a literal|--and is especially useful--|''for test tables.''|
|^SinceTheyTend| * to have WikiWord symbols in them.|}}}
'''Displays as:'''
!|ThisTableWillNotInterpret|!c any directives|'''it is treated'''|
|!1 like a literal|--and is especially useful--|''for test tables.''|
|^SinceTheyTend| * to have WikiWord symbols in them.|

!2 No Link Generating tables
If you don't want Wikiwords, URL's or E-mail adresses interpreted in the table, but you do want symbols like !-!today-! interpreted, then you can use a special form where your table is preceded with a ^ character:
'''Markup Text'''
{{{^|ThisTableWillExclude|WikiWords, http://links|and email@adress.es          |
|from being parsed,  |however                |''it will respect formatting''|
|and parse symbols like !-!today (yyyyMMdd)-!                               |}}}
'''Displays as:'''
^|ThisTableWillExclude|WikiWords, http://links|and email@adress.es          |
|from being parsed,  |however                |''it will respect formatting''|
|and parse symbols like !today (yyyyMMdd)                                   |

!2 Hidden table heads
You can hide the first row of a table. This allows you to write comment tables that just look like ordinary HTML tables.
The complete table still gets executed, the first row is just hidden by a CSS rule.
Precede the first row with a '-'. This also works for literal tables.

'''Markup Text'''
{{{-!|Comment|
|Beta|gamma|Delta|
|1|2|3|}}}
'''Displays as:'''
-!|Comment|
|Beta|gamma|Delta|
|1|2|3|
