It is relatively simple to marry !-FitNesse-! to your source code control system.

TODO: Describe usage of fitnesse.wiki.VersionsController.

In older versions the convention was to create a CmSystem class: a class that fulfilled the CmSystem protocol. Althoug hthis appeared to work fine on paper the real world version had some downsides. For one it was not in control with the saving of the content, now the VersionsController is in charge of this. Also the protocol was quite cumbersome and it involved Java introspection logic to get it working. Why does your wiki page have to "know" about version control anyway...

The VersionsController solution will be more solid can be made to provide generic solutions towards version control in FitNesse.
