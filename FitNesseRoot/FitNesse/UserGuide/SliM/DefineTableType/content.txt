|Define table type |
|Bowling | as Table |

The "Define table type" table is designed to help you write more readable tests. 

In the above example we have defined Bowling as a Table fixture.   Once you have defined the type like this you can just use "Bowling" in your test table and don't need to write "Table: Bowling".

For example, the following table will now work:
|Bowling|
|3|5|4|/|X||X||3|4|6|/|7|2|3|4|9|-|4|/|3|
||8 ||28||51||68||75||92||101||108||117|||127|

Using this fixture makes your test pages easier to read, especially for project managers, BA's and Product owners who might not understand how Fitnesse works.   (The "table:" or "query:" strings are just a test implementation detail and therefore it is good to leave them out where ever possible.)

Hint: Try putting the "Define Table Type" fixtures in the same place as your "Import" fixtures.   The setup pages are a good place for these!
