!2 Downloading and Installing FitNesse
It really takes very little time and effort to get FitNesse running on your machine.
 1 Go to !style_code(http://fitnesse.org/FitNesseDevelopment.DownLoad) and click on the most recent "''Full Distribution''". Save the !style_code(fitnesse.zip) to some directory.  Let's call that directory ''root''.
 2 Unzip !style_code(fitnesse.zip).
  * This should create a !style_code(''fitnesse'') directory below ''root'' with the following files and folders:
  * !style_code(!-FitNesseRoot-!, README.txt, dotnet, license.txt, fitnesse.jar, run.bat, run.sh)
 3 Now go to the !style_code(''root''/fitnesse) folder and type !style_code(java -jar fitnesse.jar)
  * If you have nothing running on port 80 on your machine, you should see a message similar to the following: 
   * !style_code(Fitnesse (''date code'')) !style_code( Started...)
   * !style_code(on port      80)
   * !style_code(using path   '.')
   * !style_code(using dir    '!-FitNesseRoot-!')
   * !style_code(Not logging.)
  * If you don't see this, you may have something running on port 80 already,
   * So try the command !style_code(java -jar fitnesse.jar -p 8080)
   * If you are still having trouble then check out FitNesseWontStart.

 4 Start up a browser and go to !style_code(http://localhost)
  * ''or if you had to edit run.bat in step 3 then go to !style_code(http://localhost:8080).''
 5 The main FitNesse screen should come up. That's it. You're ready to start using FitNesse.
 6 By the way, the !style_code(run.sh) and !style_code(run.bat) commands, and their !style_code(stop) counterparts are helpful little scripts you can use to start and stop !-FitNesse-! should you so desire.  But typing !style_code(java -jar fitnesse.jar) really isn't that hard...
!2 Learning More
If you have not yet done so, check out the TwoMinuteExample. To learn more about what FitNesse acceptance testing is all about, see AcceptanceTests.  If you are ready to start creating FitNesse pages and test tables, check out EditingFitNessePages and CreatingTestTables.

!2 Memory Issues.  
With the 20090320 release, some operations in !-FitNesse-! take more than the default memory allocated to the JVM.  This can cause tests to fail for ''out of heap space'' reasons.  You can fix this by adding the !style_code(!--Xmx100M-!) JVM argument to the java command line when you start !-FitNesse-!.  !style_code(!-java -Xmx100M -jar fitnesse.jar-!).

!3 Memory issues and the build.
If you build !-FitNesse-! from source, the ant script may fail for ''out of heap space'' reasons.  You can fix this by setting the !style_code(ANT_OPTS) environment variable to !style_code(!--Xmx100M-!).
