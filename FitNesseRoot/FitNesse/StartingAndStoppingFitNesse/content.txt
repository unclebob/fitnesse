!2 Starting FitNesse

In the standard distribution there is a file named ''run.bat'' for windows and ''run.sh'' for unix/linux/osx.  Double clicking this file should get things going in most cases.  The main class that gets executed is '''fitnesse.FitNesse'''.  Here is the usage for the '''FitNesse''' class:
{{{Usage: java fitnesse.FitNesse [-pdrleoa]
        -p <port number> {80}
        -d <working directory> {.}
        -r <page root directory> {FitNesseRoot}
        -l <log directory> {no logging}
        -e <days> {14} Number of days before page versions expire
        -o omit updates
        -a {user:pwd | user-file-name} enable authentication.
}}}
'''{values between braces are default values}'''
Most of the options here speak for themselves.  The most commonly used option is -p which allows you to change the port on which the FitNesse server will start.

See PasswordFile for a description of how to set up per user authentication.

!2 Stopping FitNesse

Historically, pressing ''ctrl-c'' has worked well.  However, it's not sufficient for automated control.  There is a class to stop FitNesse as well.
{{{Usage: java fitnesse.Shutdown [-pa]
        -h <hostname> {localhost}
        -p <port number> {80}
        -c <username> <password> Supply user credentials.  Use when FitNesse has authentication activated.
}}}  
This command will send an HTTP request to the designated server.  If the server is using authentication then the '''-c''' option should be used with appropriate username and password.

Alternatively you may manually type a URL to shutdown a server.
