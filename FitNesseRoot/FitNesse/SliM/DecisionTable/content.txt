This is a decision table; sometimes known as a truth table.  This particular table has three inputs and one output.

Here is the fixture code that it invokes:{{{
package fitnesse.slim.test;

public class ShouldIBuyMilk {
  private int dollars;
  private int pints;
  private boolean creditCard;

  public void setCashInWallet(int dollars) {
    this.dollars = dollars;
  }

  public void setPintsOfMilkRemaining(int pints) {
    this.pints = pints;
  }

  public void setCreditCard(String valid) {
    creditCard = "yes".equals(valid);
  }

  public String goToStore() {
    (pints == 0 && (dollars > 2 || creditCard)) ? "yes" : "no";
  }

  public void execute() {
  }
} }}}

That pretty much explains it all.  But let's look at the details a bit more closely.

First of all, there's the name of the table: "should I buy milk".  This is named for a decision to be made.  That's good style.  Decision tables should be named for decisions.  However that name also translates to the fixture class !-ShouldIBuyMilk-!.  If you run this test you'll notice that the name turns green.  This means that Slim found the fixture class and was able to create an instance of it.

The first cell could also have been ''Decision:should I buy milk'', or ''DT:should I buy milk'', or ''ShouldIBuyMilk'', etc..  The code ''Decision:'' or ''DT:'' tells Slim what kind of table this is.  Decision table is the default.

Next, there's the row of column headers.  If you look carefully at them you'll see that they all correspond to functions in the fixture class.  However, the first three correspond to ''set'' functions.  That's because they don't have a ''?''.  The Decision Table considers them to be inputs, and automatically calls the appropriately named ''set'' function.

The last column header does have a ''?''.  Decision Table considers it to be an output and so calls it as a function and expects a return value.  That return value is compared to the contents of the column and turns the corresponding cell red or green depending whether it matches.  Note that the cell that contains 'nope' does not match the 'no' that is returned.

The flow is very simple.  The table is processed one row at a time.
 1 First all the inputs are loaded by calling the appropriate set functions.
 2 Then the ''execute'' function of the fixture is called.
 3 Finally all the output functions are called and the return values compared to their table cells.

There's not much more to it than that.

!4 Well, yes there is.
But for that you should look at SymbolsInTables and ValueComparisons
